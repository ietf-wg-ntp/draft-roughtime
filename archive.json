This seems highly undesirable\r\n\r\n> Second, the grease section seems to contain no mechanisms for actually\r\nexercising either the ignoring of unknown tags by servers (or clients\r\nfor that matter) nor for exercising the version negotiation mechanism.\r\nGiven the experience in TLS with this, this is probably a really good\r\nidea to include.\r\n\r\n> Finally, the grease section indicates the server must send malformed\r\npackets some amount of the time to clients to exercise the rejection\r\nmechanism, but doesn't specify in which way it may malform the\r\npackets. Thus servers could do this in ways that could potentially\r\nreduce future design space. I would be much more comfortable if we\r\nspecified a specific set of things the server is allowed to do to\r\ncreate malformed packets, so that we at least have control over which\r\nparts of the future design space are excluded.\r\n\r\nThis was also discussed at [interim](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-interim-2024-ntp-04-202409171500/) yesterday.",

The current structure of server response is a few layers deep, and I'd propose a flattening out of it. If we represent it as something JSON-like, it should look as of -11 like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  VER: uint32,\r\n  PATH: Path,\r\n  INDX: uint32,\r\n  CERT: {\r\n    SIG: ed25519ctx signature,\r\n    DELE: {\r\n      MINT: Timestamp,\r\n      MAXT: Timestamp,\r\n      PUBK: ed25519 public key,\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  SIG: edd25519ctx signature,\r\n  SREP: {\r\n    ROOT: Root,\r\n    MIDP: Timestamp,\r\n    RADI: uint32\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is a slight restructure, flattening out:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  VER: uint32,\r\n  PATH: Path,\r\n  INDX: uint32,\r\n  CSIG: ed25519ctx signature,\r\n  CERT: {\r\n    MINT: Timestamp,\r\n    MAXT: Timestamp,\r\n    PUBK: ed25519 public key\r\n  },\r\n  TSIG: ed25519ctx signature,\r\n  SREP: {\r\n    ROOT: Root,\r\n    MIDP: Timestamp,\r\n    RADI: uint32\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThere's a few reasons for this:\r\n* By having the time and cert signatures with distinct tags, implementers have a clearer delineation of what the tag represents, not based on it's placement in the structure\r\n* Removes a layer of nesting, which is a _tiny_ payload size improvement\r\n* Existing implementations could support this and old without exclusively depending on accurate version reporting - by checking for CSIG (and DELE), validation of CERT/DELE could be handled appropriately.",
